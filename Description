This is a compiler project done by NITK Surathkal Students for all CSE engineering students.
This project is issued in general interest in hope it will guide students to learn and effectively they will learn and develop it more and add more features.


Features Implemented :

1. Syntax Phase : Almost all common keywords but no preprocessing headers, etc

2. Semantic phase :
	a. type mismatch of int, char,float,double
	b. undeclared identifier
	c. multiple declaration

3. Intermediate Code Generation: expressions and for-loop.
